# Choice Software Platform

* Decision: choosing a Software Platform to developed the application on.

In the context of `Choosing a Software Platform`, <br>
facing `the need to contain real-time chats to specific users`, <br>
we decided for `DotNet (.NET) & the ASP.NET Core SignalR library`, <br>
and neglected `Java libraries & Node.JS package like Socket.IO`, <br>
to achieve `grouping users together that communicatie in the same chat channel & better concurrency`, <br>
accepting `that the community support might not be as large as option from the other languages/frameworks`.
